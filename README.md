Socioeconomic Bias in the Education System

Although many blame the education system for the failure of many students, the root is not simply just the flaws in the system; it is the continuing underlying socioeconomic bias that is prevalent through society. Some critical implications of this bias include: an increase in crime, incarceration, and mass unemployment, thus further fueling the cycle of poverty. Therefore, the likely root of the continuing cycle is the underlying socioeconomic bias that is within education. To address this dilemma, a statistical connection needs to be conducted between broad forms of financial bias to the ongoing increase of its implications in education. Furthermore, a Machine Learning algorithm needs to be made to predict the general path of the implications. Lastly, Artificial Intelligence would be utilized to simulate the bias to the outcomes. Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence would be needed to identify, address, and predict socioeconomic bias and its connections to the grave outcomes rooted within education in America. Our intentions are not to solve the crisis, but to analyze the causes and effects of this bias in society and bring greater awareness to ultimately lower the prevalent socioeconomic bias and increase equity.
